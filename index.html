Education
Université de Bordeaux, France
Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Doctorate (2010 – 2015)
Metabolic network is a linked series of biochemical reactions that begins with a particular molecule and converts it into some other molecule or molecules in a carefully defined fashion in living organisms. Studying these networks is one of the current challenges in the field of biology, computer science, statistics and related other disciplines. We are working with a technique in graph theory to inhibit the production of a certain objective product in the network. The obtained results are really huge.
Classification of these results can be considered as a way to gain in-depth insight into a few of the specific functions. For instance, how do we find the solutions to obstruct the production of starch in plant cell metabolism.
Finding new methods to model, analyse and predict biological functions in Metabolic Networks.
My PhD dissertation supervised by MdC. Marie Beurton-Aimar is publicly accessible here.
